Group 9 Plans

End Goal: Create an RL simulation of tag that will train one group of agents to tag the other team and then train another group of agents to run away from the other team. Then, these agents will be placed into a new game such as freeze tag or capture the flag to analyze if the agents' behaviors transfer well.

Subgoals:

1. Create the world environment using Mujoco and OpenAI.
    - Get Mujoco and Gym installed
    - Learn about world generation and Mujoco
    - Create or find all of the models necessary for the environment
    - Create the randomized environment
2. Create the environment of the game within OpenAI Gym, in this case being tag.
3. Train the agents on the game of tag using OpenAI.
4. Create the environment of the second game within OpenAI Gym.
5. Analyze if the agents exemplify emergent behavior like cooperation and strategy on the second game.
